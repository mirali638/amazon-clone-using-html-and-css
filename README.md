# amazon-clone-using-html-and-css

 This is a small project where I recreated the Amazon website using HTML and CSS. It's a beginner-friendly frontend development exercise aimed at learning the basics of web design. Take a look at the code and feel free to contribute or use it for your own learning purposes!
